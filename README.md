# ChurnMLPred

In this case, we're going to develop a churn prediction develop model for a telecommunication company. This model will be used to predict customer churn within a given dataset. The model will be trained based on the previously available data which contains more than 15 features and its label (whether a customer churned or not)

The model is expected to have a good performance and high interpretability. In addition, the result of the model (customer that is predicted to be churning) will receive further treatment by the marketing department.
